        <p>Penny Auction Software facilitates a smart way of selling products to users online. It’s a kind of game auction where participants pay a bidding fee each time they make a bid that is not refundable and participate in the auction. The auction price starts with 0 and each time a participant makes bids the price of the auction increase by XX cent amount. The auction lasts for XX seconds which is set by the site owner. So the participant who makes the last bid before the auction closed will win the product. Another interesting fact is if someone makes a bid before 10 seconds of auction time then auction time will be extended by another 10 seconds.</p>
